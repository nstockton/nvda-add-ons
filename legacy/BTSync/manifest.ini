description = """
This add-on currently provides the following Accessibility improvements for BTSync:
1.  Prevents list view objects from firing multiple focus events.  Without this fix, NVDA would repeat the currently focused list item of some list views incessantly.
2.  Lets the user tab and shift-tab between the Transfers tab item and the Transfers list view.
3.  Labels some edit boxes within the program that have incorrect or no labels.
4.  allows the user to navigate the inaccessible first 3 screens of the setup wizard using the keyboard.
Note that the last version of BTSync to work with this add-on is V1.3.109. Newer versions of BTSync use a completely new, inaccessible GUI.
