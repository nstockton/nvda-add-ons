description = """
This add-on is an enhanced version of the mIRC App Module included in NVDA.
1.  The NVDA navigator object is now automaticly set to the output window of mIRC in order to make reviewing output easier.
2.  Two new hotkeys (NVDA-8 and NVDA-9) toggle the "speech interrupt for typed characters" and "speech interrupt for enter key" settings respectively.
3.  Additionally, NVDA-Enter and numbpad-Enter will set the position of the NVDA navigator object to the last line of text in the output window and speak it.
4.  The "report Dynamic Content Changes", "caret moves review cursor", "speech interrupt for typed characters", and "speech interrupt for enter key" settings are now automaticly saved when the mIRC window loses focus and restored when it receives focus again.
Note: NVDA's "report Dynamic Content Changes" setting is enabled by default.  If you want to turn off the automatic announcement of mIRC output, you may want to toggle this setting off with the NVDA-5 hotkey.
