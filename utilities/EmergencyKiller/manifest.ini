description = """
This add-on works by running an Auto Hotkey script (Emergency_NVDA_Killer.exe), which sits in the user's system tray and reacts to mouse click events.
The source code to Emergency_NVDA_Killer.exe can be found in the file Emergency_NVDA_Killer.ahk in the install location of this add-on.
Usage:
Press left mouse button + right mouse button to terminate NVDA.
Press left mouse button + middle mouse button to terminate any running instances of FireFox, WaterFox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Microsoft Edge. Note that on a lot of mice, the scroll wheel functions as a middle mouse button.
